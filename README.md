# Airline Reservation System ðŸ›«
Through this project i got to know about java's swing and awt by which i have created this Airline Reservation System. Used <ins>PostgreSQL</ins> as a database to store the desired info.  
My previous knowledge on JDBC helped me to navigate through this project easily, while learning how to build a working user interface through java's GUI ( awt (abstract window toolkit) and swing) libraries.  
I have done this Project through <ins>Apache NetBeans IDE</ins>, It was a little difficult to navigate to push this project to github when compared to IntelliJ or VS Code, but it was fun.
